With the rise of digitalization, e-commerce applications have developed an additional advantage for customers, allowing them to purchase desired products based on website reviews. Reviews are undoubtedly a crucial factor for a buyer to consider when purchasing a product. According to a study conducted by Amazon, in 2017, it was shown that more than 88% of online shoppers trust reviews as if they were personal recommendations. As a result, a product with many positive reviews will have higher credibility, while a product with many negative reviews or few reviews can cause skepticism among customers and a reduction in sales. (Amazon, 2018) Thus, in the decision-making process, consumers want to find relevant reviews as quickly as possible. Therefore, models capable of predicting the user's rating from the text review are crucial and by understanding the overall review, consumers on the one hand could improve their experience and on the other hand businesses could increase sales and if required improve the product by understanding the consumer's needs. (Uma Maheswari Raju, 2020) This project's goal is to develop a model to predict user ratings, the usefulness of reviews, and recommend the most similar articles to users based on the recommender and itÂ´s structure will be followed in this way.
